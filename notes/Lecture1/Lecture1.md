### What is Cloud Computing?

* Cloud Computing is a jargon term without a commonly accepted non-ambiguous scientific or technical definition.
* Cloud Computing is a colloquial expression used to describe a variety of different types of computing concepts that involve a large number of computers that are connected through a real-time communication network.

### Cloud Characteristics
* <font color='red'>On-demand self-service</font>: A consumer can provision computing capabilities as needed without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
* <font color='red'>Networked access</font>: Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous client platforms.
* <font color='red'>Resource pooling</font>: The providerâ€™s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model potentially with different physical and virtual resources that can be dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. 
* <font color='red'>Rapid elasticity</font>: Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some case automatically, to scale rapidly upon demand.
* <font color='red'>Measured service</font>: Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service
